# docbox
docbox is a dynamic documentation system without predefined data types or structure.

docbox is a documentation database giving its users full freedom over the way they document data.  
The main workflow is as follows:

1. create a top-level data group, say `clients`
2. define a schema for `clients`: `{ name: String, phone: String, property: DataType }` (you know the drill)
3. create a second-level data node, say `clients.ACMECompany`
4. create a third-level data group, say `clients.ACMECompany.workstations`
5. define a schema for `workstations`  
...  

In the end, you get a data structure that can be represented like so:  

````javascript
var data = {
  clients: [
    {
      name: 'ACMECompany',
      phone: '+12 345',
      property: 'foo',
      workstations: [
        {
          hostname: 'ws01',
          ip: '172.17.0.201',
          os: 'linux'
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
};
````
This is the stuff most IT companies need to store about their customers, for example. 


You can define several entity types, each of which can hold unlimited entities by themselves:
- **container entities**: think of hierarchical grouping nodes, like folders
- lists: containers that hold multiple entities of the same type, think of tables
- **data entities**: configurable, extendable data objects. Think of table rows. These are templatable, meaning: Once you created an entity, you can save its representation (name, fields etc.) as a template to reuse it easily. Docbox will ship with a set of predefined templates. Data entities can, but don't have to, be children of lists.
- **text entities**: entities that let you write text (formatted with markdown), to write down things not properly explained by data entities.
- **special entities**: entities with special requirements, like file entities that hold a file for download and its preview, if available for this file type, like images or PDFs. *Note: I plan on creating a plugin infrastructure so you can extend this with own file drivers*

Docbox does not impose any on you here, really: You can define the structure you need for your documentation. What makes this useful though is full text search: You can search for strings and receive the matching entities, optionally filtered by entity type (that's any of the entities defined by you). You need the list of workstations of customer ACMECompany? Search for "ACM", filter by entity type "workst", et voil√†, there you go.
